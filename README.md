# PuzzleScripts
## About
The goal of this project is to create easy-to-access scripts for use during puzzle hunts. Ideally, these scripts should be easily accessible to people who may not be a fluent in CS or Python. As a result, some scripts are simply wrappers for existing Python functions albeit maybe in a more logical organization or a more readable name.
